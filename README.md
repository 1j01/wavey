# [![](images/icon-32.png) Audio Editor][app]

[This is the audio editor of the future.][app]

And by that, I partially mean that it will be an audio editor *in* the future.


### Features

* Drag and drop audio files
* Always saved locally
* Persistent undo/redo
* Several themes, including light and dark [elementary OS][] themes via [elementary.css][], and some retro themes


### Future Features

Note how the bar with beat markings is a track. It would become a metronome when unmuted.

Tracks will be able to be pinned to the top, which should easy the pain when you have many tracks with audio clips you want to line up with some main audio track(s).

You will be able to "precord" up to five minutes or as long as precording has been enabled.

What do you think of the name Wavey editor? (not "Wavy" editor)
